# Boundier Prototype/Demo - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Hybrid - Design System with Wellness App Inspiration

**Rationale:** Boundier is a digital wellbeing tool requiring clear data presentation and intuitive interactions (utility-focused), but as a prototype/demo, it must visually communicate trust, calm, and cognitive clarity to effectively pitch the concept.

**References:**
- Apple Screen Time: Clean data visualization, calming aesthetics
- Headspace: Wellness-focused color psychology, friendly interactions
- Stripe Dashboard: Clear information hierarchy, precise data displays
- Arc Browser: Modern interface patterns, thoughtful overlays

**Core Principles:**
1. Cognitive Clarity: Reduce visual noise to honor the app's purpose
2. Trustworthy Aesthetics: Professional yet approachable
3. Mindful Interactions: Purposeful animations that don't distract
4. Data Transparency: Clear visualization of content analysis
